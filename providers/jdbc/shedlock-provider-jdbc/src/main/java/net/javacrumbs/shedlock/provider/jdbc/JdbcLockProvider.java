/**
 * Lock provided by plain JDBC. It uses a table that contains lock_name and locked_until.
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 * Attempts to insert a new lock record. Since lock name is a primary key, it fails if the record already exists. As an optimization,
 * we keep in-memory track of created  lock records.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * If the insert succeeds (1 inserted row) we have the lock.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * If the insert failed due to duplicate key or we have skipped the insertion, we will try to update lock record using
 * UPDATE tableName SET lock_until = :lockUntil WHERE name = :lockName AND lock_until &lt;= :now
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * If the update succeeded (1 updated row), we have the lock. If the update failed (0 updated rows) somebody else holds the lock

 * <li>
 * When unlocking, lock_until is set to now.
