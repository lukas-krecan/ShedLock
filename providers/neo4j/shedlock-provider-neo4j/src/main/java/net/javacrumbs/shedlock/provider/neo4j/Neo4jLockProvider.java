/**
 * Lock provided by Neo4j Graph API. It uses a collection that stores each lock as a node.
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 * Attempts to insert a new lock node. Since lock name has a unique constraint, it fails if the record already exists.
 * As an optimization, we keep in-memory track of created lock nodes.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * If the insert succeeds (1 node inserted) we have the lock.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * If the insert failed due to duplicate key or we have skipped the insertion, we will try to update lock node using
 * MATCH (lock:collectionName) WHERE name = $lockName AND lock_until &lt;= $now SET lock_until = $lockUntil, locked_at = $now
 * with some additional explicit node locking
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * If the update succeeded (>1 property updated), we have the lock. If the update failed (<=1 properties updated) somebody else holds the lock
 * or grabbed the lock in a data race caused by Neo4j's read-committed isolation level.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * When unlocking, lock_until is set to now.
 * </li>
