/**
 * HazelcastLockProvider.
 * <p>
 * Implementation of {@link LockProvider} using Hazelcast for store and share locks informations and mechanisms between a cluster members
 * <p>
 * Below, the mechanims :
 * - The Lock, an instance of {@link HazelcastLock}, is obtained / created when :
 * -- the lock is not not already locked by other process (lock - referenced by its name - is not present in the Hazelcast locks store OR unlockable)
 * -- the lock is expired : {@link Instant#now()} &gt; {@link HazelcastLock#timeToLive} where unlockTime have by default the same value of {@link HazelcastLock#lockAtMostUntil}
 * and can have the value of {@link HazelcastLock#lockAtLeastUntil} if unlock action is used
 * --- expired object is removed
 * -- the lock is owned by not available member of Hazelcast cluster member
 * --- no owner objectis removed
 * - Unlock action :
 * -- removes lock object when {@link HazelcastLock#lockAtLeastUntil} is not come
 * -- override value of {@link HazelcastLock#timeToLive} with {@link HazelcastLock#lockAtLeastUntil} (its default value is the same of {@link HazelcastLock#lockAtLeastUntil}
