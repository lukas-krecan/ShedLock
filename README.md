ShedLock does one and only one thing. It makes sure your scheduled tasks are executed at most once at the same time. 
If a task is being executed on one node, it acquires a lock which prevents execution of the same task from another node (or thread). 
Please note, that **if one task is already being executed on one node, execution on other nodes does not wait, it is simply skipped**.
 
Currently, Spring scheduled tasks coordinated through Mongo, JDBC database, Redis, Hazelcast or ZooKeeper are supported. More
scheduling and coordination mechanisms and expected in the future.

Feedback and pull-requests welcome!

#### ShedLock is not a distributed scheduler
Please note that ShedLock is not and will never be full-fledged scheduler, it's just a lock. If you need a distributed scheduler, please use another project.
ShedLock is designed to be used in situations where you have scheduled tasks that are not ready to be executed in parallel, but can be safely
executed repeatedly. For example if the task is fetching records from a database, processing them and marking them as processed at the end without
using any transaction. In such case ShedLock may be right for you.

## Usage
### Requirements and dependencies
* Java 8
* slf4j-api
* Spring Framework (optional)


### Import project

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>net.javacrumbs.shedlock</groupId>
    <artifactId>shedlock-spring</artifactId>
    <version>1.3.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### Annotate your scheduled tasks
 
 ```java
import net.javacrumbs.shedlock.core.SchedulerLock;

...

@Scheduled(...)
@SchedulerLock(name = "scheduledTaskName")
public void scheduledTask() {
    // do something
}
```
        
The `@SchedulerLock` annotation has several purposes. First of all, only annotated methods are locked, the library ignores
all other scheduled tasks. You also have to specify the name for the lock. Only one tasks with the same name can be executed
at the same time. 

You can also set `lockAtMostFor` attribute which specifies how long the lock should be kept in case the
executing node dies. This is just a fallback, under normal circumstances the lock is released as soon the tasks finishes.

Lastly, you can set `lockAtLeastFor` attribute which specifies minimum amount of time for which the lock should be kept. 
Its main purpose is to prevent execution from multiple nodes in case of really short tasks and clock difference between the nodes.

#### Example 
Let's say you have a task which you execute every 15 minutes and which usually takes few minutes to run. 
Moreover, you want to execute it at most once per 15 minutes. In such case, you can configure it like this

 ```java
import net.javacrumbs.shedlock.core.SchedulerLock;

...
private static final String FOURTEEN_MIN = "PT14M";
...

@Scheduled(cron = "0 */15 * * * *")
@SchedulerLock(name = "scheduledTaskName", lockAtMostForString = FOURTEEN_MIN, lockAtMostForString = FOURTEEN_MIN)
public void scheduledTask() {
    // do something
}

```
By setting `lockAtMostFor` we make sure that the lock is released even if the node dies and by setting `lockAtLeastFor`
we make sure it's not executed more than once in fifteen minutes. 
Please note that **`lockAtMostFor` is just a safety net for a case that the node executing the task dies, so set it to 
a time that is significantly larger than maximum estimated execution time.**  If the task takes longer than `lockAtMostFor`,
it will be executed again.


### Enable Scheduler Locking
Now we need to integrate the library into Spring. Since version 2.0.0 you can use `@EnableSchedulerLock` annotation

```java
@Configuration
@EnableScheduling
@EnableSchedulerLock(defaultLockAtMostFor = "PT30S")
class MySpringConfiguration {
    ...
}
```

#### TaskScheduler proxy
By default ShedLock creates AOP proxy around Spring `TaskScheduler`. If you do not specify your task scheduler, default one
is created for you. If you have special needs, just create a bean implementing `TaskScheduler` interface and it will get wrapped 
into AOP proxy automatically.

```java   
@Bean
public TaskScheduler taskScheduler() {
    return new MySpecialTaskScheduler();
}
```

![TaskScheduler proxy sequence diagram](https://github.com/lukas-krecan/ShedLock/raw/master/documentation/scheduler_proxy.png)


#### Scheduled Method proxy
If you have even more special needs, you can use Scheduled Method proxy like this

```java
@EnableSchedulerLock(mode = PROXY_METHOD, defaultLockAtMostFor = "PT30S")
```

If `PROXY_METHOD` mode is selected, ShedLock creates AOP proxy around every method with `@SchedulerLock` annotation. 
The main advantage of this approach is that it does not depend on Spring scheduling. The disadvantage is that the lock is applied even
if you call the method directly. Be also aware, that only void-returning methods are currently supported, an exception is thrown if you
annotate and call a method with non-void return type.

### Configure LockProvider
There are several implementations of LockProvider.  

#### Mongo
Import the project

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>net.javacrumbs.shedlock</groupId>
    <artifactId>shedlock-provider-mongo</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

Configure:

```java
import net.javacrumbs.shedlock.provider.mongo.MongoLockProvider;

...

@Bean
public LockProvider lockProvider(MongoClient mongo) {
    return new MongoLockProvider(mongo, "databaseName");
}
```

Please note that MongoDB integration requires Mongo >= 2.4 and mongo-java-driver >= 3.4.0


#### JdbcTemplate

There are two lock providers based on JDBC. JdbcTemplateLockProvider which uses Spring's JDBC template, supports transactions etc, and plain
JdbcLockProvider which asseses JDBC directly. They should work more or less the same, if in doubt, use JdbcTemplateLockProvider.
  
First, create the table

```sql
CREATE TABLE shedlock(
    name VARCHAR(64), 
    lock_until TIMESTAMP(3) NULL, 
    locked_at TIMESTAMP(3) NULL, 
    locked_by  VARCHAR(255), 
    PRIMARY KEY (name)
) 
```
script for MS SQL is [here](https://github.com/lukas-krecan/ShedLock/issues/3#issuecomment-275656227) and for Oracle [here](https://github.com/lukas-krecan/ShedLock/issues/81#issue-355599950)

Add dependency

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>net.javacrumbs.shedlock</groupId>
    <artifactId>shedlock-provider-jdbc-template</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

Configure:

```java
import net.javacrumbs.shedlock.provider.jdbctemplate.JdbcTemplateLockProvider;

...

@Bean
public LockProvider lockProvider(DataSource dataSource) {
    return new JdbcTemplateLockProvider(dataSource);
}
```

Tested with MySql, Postgres and HSQLDB, should work on all other JDBC compliant databases. 

#### Warning
**Do not manually delete lock row or document from DB table or Mongo collection.** ShedLock has an in-memory cache of existing locks
so the row will NOT be automatically recreated until application restart. If you need to, you can edit the row/document, risking only
that multiple locks will be held. Since 1.0.0 you can clean the cache by calling `clearCache()` on LockProvider.
 
#### ZooKeeper (using Curator)
Import 
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>net.javacrumbs.shedlock</groupId>
    <artifactId>shedlock-provider-zookeeper-curator</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

and configure

```java
import net.javacrumbs.shedlock.provider.zookeeper.curator.ZookeeperCuratorLockProvider;

...

@Bean
public LockProvider lockProvider(org.apache.curator.framework.CuratorFramework client) {
    return new ZookeeperCuratorLockProvider(client);
}
```
By default, ephemeral nodes for locks will be created under `/shedlock` node. 

#### Redis (using Spring RedisConnectionFactory)
Import 
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>net.javacrumbs.shedlock</groupId>
    <artifactId>shedlock-provider-redis-spring</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

and configure

```java
import net.javacrumbs.shedlock.provider.redis.spring.RedisLockProvider;
import org.springframework.data.redis.connection.RedisConnectionFactory;

...

@Bean
public LockProvider lockProvider(RedisConnectionFactory connectionFactory) {
    return new RedisLockProvider(connectionFactory, ENV);
}
```

If you have dependency on spring-data-redis 2 use ShedLock 1.x.x, if you have dependency on spring-data-redis 1 use ShedLock 0.x.x.


#### Redis (using Jedis)
Import 
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>net.javacrumbs.shedlock</groupId>
    <artifactId>shedlock-provider-redis-jedis</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

and configure

```java
import net.javacrumbs.shedlock.provider.redis.jedis.JedisLockProvider;

...

@Bean
public LockProvider lockProvider(JedisPool jedisPool) {
    return new JedisLockProvider(jedisPool, ENV);
}
```

#### Hazelcast
Import the project

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>net.javacrumbs.shedlock</groupId>
    <artifactId>shedlock-provider-hazelcast</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.1/version>
</dependency>
```

Configure:

```java
import net.javacrumbs.shedlock.provider.hazelcast.HazelcastLockProvider;

...

@Bean
public HazelcastLockProvider lockProvider(HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance) {
    return new HazelcastLockProvider(hazelcastInstance);
}
```

#### Couchbase
Import the project

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>net.javacrumbs.shedlock</groupId>
    <artifactId>shedlock-provider-couchbase-javaclient</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.1/version>
</dependency>
```

Configure:

```java
import net.javacrumbs.shedlock.provider.couchbase.javaclient.CouchbaseLockProvider;

...

@Bean
public CouchbaseLockProvider lockProvider(Bucket bucket) {
    return new CouchbaseLockProvider(bucket);
}
```


### Spring XML configuration

If you are using Spring XML config, use this configuration

```xml
<!-- lock provider of your choice (jdbc/zookeeper/mongo/whatever) -->
<bean id="lockProvider" class="net.javacrumbs.shedlock.provider.jdbctemplate.JdbcTemplateLockProvider">
    <constructor-arg ref="dataSource"/>
</bean>

<bean id="scheduler" class="net.javacrumbs.shedlock.spring.SpringLockableTaskSchedulerFactoryBean">
    <constructor-arg>
        <task:scheduler id="sch" pool-size="10"/>
    </constructor-arg>
    <constructor-arg ref="lockProvider"/>
    <constructor-arg name="defaultLockAtMostFor">
        <bean class="java.time.Duration" factory-method="ofMinutes">
            <constructor-arg value="10"/>
        </bean>
    </constructor-arg>
</bean>


<!-- Your task(s) without change (or annotated with @Scheduled)-->
<task:scheduled-tasks scheduler="scheduler">
    <task:scheduled ref="task" method="run" fixed-delay="1" fixed-rate="1"/>
</task:scheduled-tasks>
```

Annotate scheduler method(s)


```java
@SchedulerLock(name = "taskName")
public void run() {

}
```

### Running without Spring
It is possible to use ShedLock without Spring

```java
LockingTaskExecutor executor = new DefaultLockingTaskExecutor(lockProvider);

...

Instant lockAtMostUntil = Instant.now().plusSeconds(600);
executor.executeWithLock(runnable, new LockConfiguration("lockName", lockAtMostUntil));

```

## Versions
Version 1.x.x is compiled and tested with Spring 5 and Spring Data 2. It should be safe to use ShedLock 1.x.x with Spring 4
if you are not using Spring Redis lock provider which introduced incompatibility. In other words
- If you have dependency on spring-data-redis 2 - use ShedLock 1.x.x
- If you have dependency on spring-data-redis 1 - use ShedLock 0.x.x
- In all other cases, you can use both versions, prefereably 1.x.x
